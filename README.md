In 2020, the world learned to embrace technology. We went home. We made our spaces our own.

Not every new developer is going to work for the big guys. Or even the little guys. Big tech or new tech, you will need real methods that work practically. Online research can only take you so far.

If we’ve learned anything in the last few years, its that WE need be a part of the world.

There is a new collaboration site that isn’t like anything before, but everything ahead. Developers can create a profile and highlight their skills, collaborate on projects, and work through challenges with other Developers.

No more copying and pasting code from an online forum and hoping it works. No more hours of endless research on concepts that don’t fit your projects.

Connect with a developer that knows what you’re trying to accomplish. They have the skills; you have the need. Real online guidance from the people that know the code.

Developers need a team, they need collaboration. And it all begins when you say…

hello world.

**Team Note**
>This is a social media site for Developers, the idea is that USERS will have access to experts beyond an online forum. They can directly connect with other Developers. If someone that is new to this community would try to create collaboration opportunities they would have to reach out to total strangers on five (5) different websites and hope someone can help. 'hello world' makes it possible for USERS to have one (1) central location to start their collaboration opportunities.

Our team "hit the ground running" very early on. We started with a design concept then split the roles into FRONT-END and BACK-END. We set up a lot of meetings to ensure that we were passing information back-and-forth between teams. Here is the breakdown of our roles and responsibilities:

**Front-End Roles**
- Wireframe Desktop and App - **Ballard**
- React Components, Manifest, Navigation - **Will**
- React Components & Server - **Cassandra**

**Back-End Roles**
- Authentication, Login, Register, GraphQL Models - **Ramu**
- Data Objects, Stripe, and Image Hosting - **Ballard**
- PWA and Apollo - **Robert**
- FakerJS - **Stephen**

**Teamwork Note:**
>The roles assigned above are associated with the listed owners, but a lot of what we've done was collaborative. Example: Instead of just building a react component on its own, we would collaborate on what the react component does, impacts the back-end, and how it will be used on the front-end.

This challenge presented a few opportunities for us, but we dove in headfirst and came out with several wins. What made this possible was our Agile workflow. We checked in each other frequently and collaborated well.

### **Wins**
Lead Time
- Early start on the project allowed for more collaboration, planning, and execution.

Self-Challenging
- Each team member got to work on something that was challenging to them with support from the rest of the team.

Components
- Nearly twenty (20) components to create the site. We took on a difficult task.

Holistic Approach
- Avoided having a narrow scope for the sake of completion, but a holistic approach for a quality product.
<pre>
</pre>
### **Challenges**
Project Scale
- Too big even with lead time.

Components
- Each component had a range of medium to high complexity because of its functionality requirements.

Flow
- Creating a polished UX/UI that met the needs and wants of the entire group.
